<p>The beginning of my career in the web was simple enough. Learn the basics, learn a little more &amp; start working with small local startups with low budgets to gain experience. The concepts of HTML and CSS came easily enough and I felt comfortable learning enough PHP to put together a custom WordPress theme or alter existing themes to fit a given project. A regular full time job kept my focus away from the deep dive I really neeed to take it to the next level and I found myself learning just enough to make it through a client and move to the next. Real life was a blocker to legitimate momentum.</p>

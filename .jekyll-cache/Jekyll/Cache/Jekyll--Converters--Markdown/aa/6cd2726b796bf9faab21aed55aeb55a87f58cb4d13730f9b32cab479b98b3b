I"><p>2019 was a weird year. I left a job of four plus years where I was very happy and joined a much smaller company focused on eCommerce and brick and mortar retail. I can look back with pride on a number of things I accomplished at my previous role - contributing to the responsive redesign and build of an enterprise level site that had been collecting dust for years, the first <a href="https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/planning/ira-potential/index.htm">React project within the line-of-business</a> and a number of performance and workflow improvements within our team. But, having spent the last several years going deep on studying modern web stack and watching the rise of new and exciting UI platforms, I was beginning to feel antsy for a greater challenge, one where I could leverage the things I had been putting so much energy into learning. So, when the opportunity came to rebuild the front-end of a major eCommerce site as a progressive web app with the stack of my choosing and incorporate it into the new headless Magento API, it was a promise too good to pass up.</p>

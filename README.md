# Personal site redesign

Rebuilding my personal site with Jekyll

## Trimming the fat

I'm pulling out jQuery, reducing the presence of web fonts and slimming this down. Additionally, the entire site will now be built with jekyll, rather than just the blog section.

## Performance upgrades

Future enhancements will include a service worker and some clever font loading strategies borrowed from the Filament Group.

### Finding the time...

A full time job and two part time jobs on top of a full time family means this is going to take longer than I want, but hopefully committing this to GitHub will help me push on with increased motivation.

### Hoping to move on

I'd love to get this thing over to something Gatsby and headless, but I'm so short on time these days..

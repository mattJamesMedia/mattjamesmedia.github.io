  My name is Matt James and I have followed a long and circuitous path to come to the point that I am at today. I have been involved in media communications for over twenty years and began my foray into interactive media and design a little over seven years ago. When I'm not developing websites, designing and photographing for local startups or recording my thoughts, I can be found chasing kids, riding bikes and playing outside.[mattjamesmedia@gmail.com](mailto:mattjamesmedia@gmail.com) -->
